Autogenerated service with a predict function. Requires the supplied pickle file to have a `predict(X)` method that can take a pandas dataframe `X` as input and should return an object that can be converted to a list using `list()`. The function expects a dictionary in a format that can be loaded as a pandas dataframe(see https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.from_dict.html). 
To make your own customized services, please refer to the documentation.
