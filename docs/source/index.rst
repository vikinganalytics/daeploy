Welcome to the daeploy documentation!
=====================================

Daeploy is a software deployment tool that is perfect for
smaller applications where Time-to-Market and ease of use is more important than
scalability to tens of thousands of users and requests.

Daeploy strives to make writing and deploying services (small applications) as quick
and easy as possible without requiring much, or any, prior knowledge
and experience. We want Data Scientists and Algorithm Engineers to spend their time
doing what they love and less time writing `flask` API:s and `dockerfiles`.
